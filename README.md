# Maps
The maps and active rotation used on the Minehut [Warzone](https://warz.one) server.

## Updating the Repo
When adding or modifing any map in this repo, please note some of the requirements we have for our maps.

- The map must be fully pruned (The only chunks saved should be the map itself. You can use a program such as [this](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector) one).
- You must only need any necessary files (level.dat, map.json, and the region folder).
- There has to be a fully working map.json (This file is used to define any coordinates needed for the map).
- When adding new maps, make sure the map you are adding has a **commerical license** meaning, we have the full permission to add the map and use it on our server.

## Tips
If you need any additional support with making a map.json or anything else, you can try checking out our [docs](https://docs.warz.one) or by contacting a *Map Developer* on our Discord located [here](https://discord.io/WarzoneMC).
